# PERSONAL PORTFOLIO

This portfolio is not only intended to showcase my most relevant projects, but also to demonstrate my ability to plan and execute a project in a way that simulates a professional environment. Additionally, it serves as a practical challenge to strengthen my skills in HTML and CSS, two fundamental technologies of web development.

## 🧩 Features

- Custom and distinctive visual design — filing cabinet simulation.
- Classic sections — Home, About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
- Extensive use of animations and transitions to enhance user experience.
- Basic SEO optimization and accessibility compliance.
- Fully responsive design, adapted for all screen sizes.
- Built with HTML and CSS (JavaScript only for contact form).
