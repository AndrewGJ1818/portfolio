Certificate of Science and Software

Hello there, my name is

Andrew Garcia Jean

I’m learning to combine my background in biology with software development, translating the language of life into code. Currently, I'm seeking my first professional opportunity.

# About Me

2018 – 2022	BSc in Biology

2022 – 2023	MSc in Bioinformatics & Biostatistics

2024 – 2025	Self-learning in Software Development

### \> Academic Background

I hold a Bachelor’s in Biology and a Master’s in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics, during which I worked on a range of research projects, from entomological data to clinical trials. This diversity gave me a broad scientific perspective and the ability to adapt quickly to new biological contexts.

### \> Transition to Software Development

After completing my Master’s, I dedicated the past year and a half to bridging the gap between biology and computer science. Coming from a biological background, there was a lot to learn; not only programming, but also hardware, operating systems, and even improving my typing speed. I also dove into web development, exploring version control, the fundamentals of frontend and backend, and the overall process of building applications. These experiences helped me stop feeling like a visitor in the world of computing and start thinking like a developer.

### \> Strong Point

While I consider myself naturally analytical, my curiosity has driven me to take on creative projects of all kinds: from music, writing, and drawing to video game design and the creation of a collectible card game (for some reason). Each has challenged me to learn quickly and adapt, cultivating a strong creative side that complements my logical mindset.

### \> Current Goal

I’m now seeking remote opportunities where I can apply my scientific background and technical skills to real bioinformatics problems. Remote work allows me to collaborate efficiently while maintaining the independence that have shaped my learning path.

### \> Soft Skills

- **Autonomy in Problem Solving.** Nothing gives me more satisfaction than tackling a problem on my own and finding a solution independently.

- **Meticulous Attention to Detail.** My rigor has allowed me to achieve excellent results in Mathematics, Statistics, and later in Biostatistics.

- **Cross-Disciplinary Learning Agility.** I love exploring two vast worlds, such as Biology and Computer Science, and I enjoy even more applying knowledge from one to the other.

# Projects

## Personal Portfolio

A creative and technical challenge built under one rule: no JavaScript. The site delivers interactivity and animation using only HTML and CSS, supported by thorough planning and documentation that mimic a real development workflow. All illustrations are hand-drawn, giving the portfolio a distinctive and personal visual style.
