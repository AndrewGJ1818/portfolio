# Color palette

The following section presents the color palette selected for this portfolio project. The entire palette is built using complementary colors derived from a single base color, `#5D769C`. A low saturation has been applied across all tones, as it better aligns with the visual concept intended for the project. This approach helps create a cohesive and visually balanced aesthetic while maintaining a subtle and refined look.

To ensure the illustration assets remain visually engaging despite the low saturation, a range of distinct hues has been selected across the palette. This careful variation introduces enough contrast and diversity to bring a colorful feel to the visuals, without compromising the soft and muted atmosphere. The result is a balanced composition where illustrations can stand out and add personality, while still feeling cohesive within the overall design.
