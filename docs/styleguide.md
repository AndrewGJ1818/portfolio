# Color palette

The following section presents the color palette selected for this portfolio project. The entire palette is built using complementary colors derived from a single base color, `#5D769C`. A low saturation has been applied across all tones, as it better aligns with the visual concept intended for the project. This approach helps create a cohesive and visually balanced aesthetic while maintaining a subtle and refined look.

To ensure the illustration assets remain visually engaging despite the low saturation, a range of distinct hues has been selected across the palette. This careful variation introduces enough contrast and diversity to bring a colorful feel to the visuals, without compromising the soft and muted atmosphere. The result is a balanced composition where illustrations can stand out and add personality, while still feeling cohesive within the overall design.

# Design software

The design and illustration process for this portfolio was carried out entirely using [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/), an open-source vector graphics editor. Inkscape was chosen for its flexibility, precision, and compatibility with scalable design workflows, making it an ideal tool for creating clean and adaptable visual assets.

All portfolio illustrations were designed as vector graphics within Inkscape, ensuring that each element could be easily resized and adjusted without any loss of quality. To support responsive design across different devices and screen resolutions, every illustration was exported in three distinct resolutions (referred as small, medium and large). This approach allows the visual assets to maintain clarity, proportion, and aesthetic consistency whether displayed on mobile, tablet, or desktop layouts.
